# KawaiiDiscord
A set of scripts for bringing some SFMLab chat features back to Discord.
Also, a few features from BetterDiscord, ported to the web client.

## Features so far
- SFMLab emotes
- Twitch emotes
- Loads emote lists at startup
- Auto-play GIFs, without needing to hover
- Fancy Discord-style tooltips for emotes

## TODO
- Periodically re-check for new emotes while running
- Settings panel (for managing emote sets, other preferences)
- Add emotes to emoji picker
- Custom theme support
